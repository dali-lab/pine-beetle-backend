## TODO: 

send imported data through schema to normalize, check data

if errors, might be caused by collection nameâ€“mongo usually generates its own based on schema (running through schema should take care of this though)

### Starter pack
Includes express, node, and mongo dependencies (API, server, database)

### dev notes
brew install heroku/brew/heroku

Error: Couldn't find preset "env" relative to directory "/app"
